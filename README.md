# LeetcodeProblemsSolved

This repository is a comprehensive record of my journey through the LeetCode interview patterns. It contains organized notes, Python implementations, and categorized problem sets designed to build a deep intuition for algorithmic problem-solving.

## 📁 Repository Structure

* **`01-Arrays-Strings/`**: Focuses on linear data structures and techniques like Two Pointers, Sliding Window, and Prefix Sum.
* **`02-Hashing/`**: (Current Section) Exploring  lookups, frequency tracking, and mapping.
* **`03-Linked-Lists/`**: (Upcoming) Techniques for pointer manipulation and node-based structures.
* **`04-Trees-Graphs/`**: (Upcoming) Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), and traversals.

## 🛠️ Master Patterns Summary

### **1. Two Pointers**

Used for searching or manipulating arrays by tracking two positions.

* **Key Insight:** Reduces $O(N^2)$ nested loops to $O(N)$ by moving pointers toward each other or across different sequences.

### **2. Sliding Window**

A subset of two pointers used specifically for **contiguous** subarrays or substrings.

* **Key Insight:** Avoids redundant calculations by "sliding" a window and updating the state (sum, count) as elements enter or leave.

### **3. Prefix Sum**

A pre-computation technique for cumulative totals.

* **Key Insight:** Allows for $O(1)$ range sum queries by storing the "sum-so-far" at each index.

### **4. Hashing**

Using Hash Maps and Sets for efficient data retrieval.

* **Key Insight:** Exchanges space for time to achieve  average-case complexity for insertions and lookups.
